# flutter_infinite_scroll

Demonstration of an infinite scroll list.

It supports two way infinite scroll and jump to index in Flutter. It is inspired by [scrollable_positioned_list](https://pub.dev/packages/scrollable_positioned_list) and implemented infinite scroll, which is not supported by the package.
